This project is the extension of `http://luugiathuy.com/2011/02/android-java-bluetooth`

The projects is extended to control the PC mouse via mobile screen swipping (up and down) and using gyriscope for left and right.
Purpose for doing this was that I wanted to play a flight simulator using my android mobile as Joy stick
